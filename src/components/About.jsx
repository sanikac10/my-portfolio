  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>
  Iâ€™m an AI researcher and recent Computer Science graduate from Arizona State University, specializing in reasoning, in-context fine-tuning (IFT), training optimisation and alignment. My work centers on advanced reinforcement-learning algorithms (GRPO & PPO), Supervised Fine Tuning (SFT), LLM Security and reasoning-distillation (DeepSeek-R1), with a focus on robust LLM data-leakage evaluation.
